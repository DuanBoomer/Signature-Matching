# Signature Matching

### Execution Cycle
⬇️ ` Load the model without the output layer ` <br>
⬇️ ` Run the image through it and get the embeddings ` <br>
⬇️ ` Measure spacial distance between the original and to_authenticate image using correlation metric ` <br>
⬇️ ` If distance is close/small enough we have a match ` <br>
